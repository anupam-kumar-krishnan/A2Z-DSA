What is Space Complexity

- It simply means, how much memory does the program takes
- Big-O notataion, used for space complexity too

- Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Space

- Auxiliary Space -> Space that you take to solve the problem 
        +
    Input Space   -> Space that you take to take the input of the problem

variables a and b
Storing a+b in c, c=a+b

Here, we are taking an extra auxiliary space, c to solve the problem(we can use) 
but we used an extra vaiable/extra space to solve the problem, that is 
refered as "Auxiliary Space"

In the above example, 
c -> Auxiliary Space
a, b -> Input Space

Here, Space Complexity is O(3), as we are using 3 variables

For Example, 
int a[N], means it is consuimg the O(N) size

For example,
Imagine, Input given to a and b
b=a+b

Here it is not taking any Auxiliary Space, but not perfered for Interviews
You can't manipulate the Data, remember!!!

Never do anything to the input

Most of the servers takes 1s~10^8, 2s~2*10^8 per operations
